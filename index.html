    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Motivation</h2>
    <h4>Our reason for creating this product</h4>
        <p> &emsp; Oftentimes, companies will have a physical product that consumers will purchase
            then post about on social media. In order to find these posts, companies could look at
            the tags linked to the image. However, with a large number of social media posts related
            to a certain product, it may be inefficient for companies to hire someone to go through
            each post and determine how consumers react to these products when they could use
            Computer Vision to do that work for them. The ability to understand how customers
            respond to products is an essential factor needed for a company to be successful.
            Through analyzing customer feedback and reactions, companies can get a better idea
            of their productsâ€™ success as well as get new ideas based on customer reactions that
            they could incorporate into future products to increase the number of consumers as well
            as customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Through solving this issue, companies could have a tool at their disposal that
            allows them to see how people respond and react to their product on social media using
            an automated process. Otherwise, companies would have to give someone a role in
            which they have to manually go through social media platforms post by post. This could
            be both costly for companies and a repetitive job for whoever is in that role. As such,
            whoever would have been assigned to such a role could work on something more
            meaningful and exciting while saving companies money as the software would cost 
            significantly less than hiring someone to perform this task. Additionally, we have ensured
            that this software program has a high enough level of certainty when analyzing images
            so that companies can rest assured that they can trust the results produced by the
            software.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Approach</h2>
    <h4>Our initial plan</h4>
        <p>&emsp;For feature extraction and emotion classification, we planned to first implement
            existing feature extraction and classification models such as regression trees and
            ensembling methods to get baseline results. Then we could try to combine different
            models to see if we can get better results. We wanted to build the model with the following steps:</p>
            <p>&emsp;1. Acquiring image datasets from online databases.</p>
            <p>&emsp;2. Using techniques such as edge/corner detection to detect whether the image
                contains a face and the position of the face. We may need to create bounding
                boxes for the detected faces so that it is easier to extract features from faces.</p>
            <p>&emsp;3. Preprocessing the image (e.g. resizing, color correction, noise removal). We
                probably need to use image smoothing techniques such as Gaussian filters to
                filter the unwanted noise from the image.</p>
            <p>&emsp;4. Extracting the important features from the face that can be used to classify the
                emotions of the facial expressions.</p>
            <p>&emsp;5. Training an emotion classification model using the training dataset.</p>
            <p>&emsp;6. Testing the accuracy of our model using the testing dataset</p>
            <p>We also planned to use the classification accuracy (i.e. the percentage of correctly predicted
            emotions) on the testing dataset to evaluate the performance of our model.</p>
