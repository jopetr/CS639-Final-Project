    <h4>Our reason for creating this product</h4>
        <p> &emsp; Oftentimes, companies will have a physical product that consumers will purchase
            then post about on social media. In order to find these posts, companies could look at
            the tags linked to the image. However, with a large number of social media posts related
            to a certain product, it may be inefficient for companies to hire someone to go through
            each post and determine how consumers react to these products when they could use
            Computer Vision to do that work for them. The ability to understand how customers
            respond to products is an essential factor needed for a company to be successful.
            Through analyzing customer feedback and reactions, companies can get a better idea
            of their productsâ€™ success as well as get new ideas based on customer reactions that
            they could incorporate into future products to increase the number of consumers as well
            as customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Through solving this issue, companies could have a tool at their disposal that
            allows them to see how people respond and react to their product on social media using
            an automated process. Otherwise, companies would have to give someone a role in
            which they have to manually go through social media platforms post by post. This could
            be both costly for companies and a repetitive job for whoever is in that role. As such,
            whoever would have been assigned to such a role could work on something more
            meaningful and exciting while saving companies money. Additionally, we would ensure
            that this software program has a high enough level of certainty when analyzing images
            so that companies can rest assured that they can trust the results produced by the
            software.</p>
